## Introduction
These were assignments from programming lagauge. I highly encourage you to not use them in your own assignments. 
The assignments involved making lexer, parser, most general unifier, type checker, toy logic interpreter and abstarct machines.

### A1: Vector and matrix artihmetic
First assignment was to make us familier with OCaml environment. Wrote some function involved computing product, addition, inverse
of matrices and vectors.

### A2: Lexer
A simple lexer for toy spreedsheet language was made using OCamllex capable of identifying simple tokens of number and function primitives.

### A3: Parser
Extending the previous assignemnt this assignemnt involved creating grammer for toy spreedsheet language invovling simple arithmetic operations.

### A4: Complete Spreedsheet language
This assignment involved making simple type checker for above toy logic, resolving intermediate representation into final resultant spreedsheet.
